# Laptop Provisioning

This is a set of Ansible roles/tasks to configure my Ubuntu-based laptop (currently Yakkety Yak).

It's fairly simple, nothing really fancy going on. I didn't want to invest much time in it, most of this has been created in roughly 2 hours. Should you have questions/concerns/ideas for improvements just send me a message, hit me up on Twitter or submit a PR. Thanks!

## Prerequisites

- Python 2.x

For testing:

- Vagrant >= 1.9.3
- VirtualBox >= 5.1.x

## Testing

```sh
$ vagrant up
```

You should have a box provisioned using the playbook afterwards.
